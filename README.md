# Data-structure

Tree data structure :

A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
                                       
Tree terminologies:-

 1. Node:  It is an entity that contains a key and pointers to its child node. The last node of each path are called leaf nodes/external nodes that do not contain                a pointer to child nodes. 
           The nodes having atleast a child node is called an inernal node.
               
 2. Edge:  It is a link between any two nodes.
 
 3. Root: Topmost node of a tree.
 
 4. Height: The height of the node is the longest path from the node to a leaf node.
 
 5. Height of a tree: The height of a tree is the height of the root node .
 
 6. Depth of a node: It is the number of edges from the root to the node.
 
 Types of Tree:-
 
 1.  General Tree: It has no restriction on the number of nodes that is a parent node can have any number of children.
 
 2.  Binary Tree: A node of a binary tree can have a maximum of two child nodes.
                                     
 3. Blanaced Tree: If the height of the left subtree anf the right subtree is equal or differ atmost by 1. the tree is known as a balanced tree.
 
 4. Binary Search Tree: These trees are used for various searching and sorting algorithms. 
                         The examples are  AVL Tree and Red-Black Tree.
                         
                         
 Types of Binary Tree:-
  
 1. Full binary tree / strict binary tree: The tree is considered to be a full binary tree if each node contains either 0 or 2 children.
  
 2. Complete binary tree: It is a tree in which all the nodes are completely filled except the last level. In the last level, all nodes must be as left as possible.
  
 3. Perfect binary tree: A tree is a perfect binary tree if all the internal nodes have 2 children, and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
  
 4. Balanced binary tree: It is a tree in which both the left and right subtrees differ by atmost 1.
  
 5. Degenerate binary tree: It is a tree in which all the internal nodes have only one child. 
 
 Binary tree traversal technique:-
 
 Traversal can be done using DFS/BFS.
 1. Depth first search traversal:  
    a. Inorder traversal   (left, root, right) 
    b. Preorder traversal  (root, left, right)
    c. Postorder traversal (left, right, root)
                                   
 2. Breadth first search traversal.
